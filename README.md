## New README

I was looking for a software that can do tracing drawings on desktop for drawing in specific games.
I am very bad on drawing on free hand, so I am Hoping this software can help me.


The original version was written in VB.net. I have converted to csharp and update to .net framework 9 / windows-7.

## Original README

Original URL [https://sourceforge.net/projects/ctio/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ctio/)


Ordinarily used for tracing one image to an editor for art and drawings, but can also be used from alignment of objects to 
visual disabilities that need temporary hue changes that can be quickly removed. the image window is click through so clicking 
on on it results to clicking on what's behind it. the image window is movable and re-sizable by checking the lock to move. 
Also supports web cam overlay and a basic 10pt black on white text overlay.

Features
displays images, web cam feed, and text (10pt black on white) in an overlay with adjustable transparency while being invisible to mouse clicks.
the overlay can be resized to fit various needs.
